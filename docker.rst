Docker Tutorial
===============

Overview
--------

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers allow developers to package an application with all of its dependencies, including libraries and runtime, and ship it as a single package. This ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments, making it easy to deploy and scale.

Docker Images (Layered Architecture)
------------------------------------

Docker uses a layered architecture for images, providing efficiency and flexibility. Each layer in a Docker image represents a set of file changes or instructions in the Dockerfile. Layers are cached, and if there are no changes in a particular layer, Docker reuses the cached layer, speeding up the image build process.

The layered architecture allows for incremental builds and facilitates sharing common layers between different images, reducing the overall storage space. This layered approach is fundamental to Docker's efficiency and is a key factor in its popularity.

Difference in Docker Images and Containers
------------------------------------------

**Docker Images:**

- Docker images are the building blocks for containers.
- They are lightweight, standalone, and executable packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.
- Images are defined by a set of layers, each representing a specific instruction in the Dockerfile.

**Docker Containers:**

- Containers are instances of Docker images that run in isolation on the host system.
- They encapsulate the application and its dependencies, ensuring consistent behavior across different environments.
- Containers are portable, enabling seamless deployment across various environments without modification.

In summary, Docker images are static, immutable blueprints for applications, while containers are the dynamic, runnable instances of those images.
